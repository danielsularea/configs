# Daniel's configs 

# You should read below if you want to use these

Most of these configs are from the days I was using Arch. Everything is available in
the repos so you don't need to compile anything from source.

You will need to modify some of the paths in a few files as they include my name. 
For xmonad, copy the dir `.xmonad` into your home directory and recompile with:
	`xmonad --recompile` 

My config uses `dzen2`, you'll have to install that as well. Previously I was using `xmobar`
and the config for it, `xmobarrc`, is in this repo. You can use it but you'll have to 
modify `xmonad.hs`. Read arch docs on xmonad.

Clickable workspaces uses `xdotool`, make sure you install it (it's available in the repos).

`gtkrc2.0-mine` fixes the large padding in eclipse. 

Everything else is pretty self-explanatory.
